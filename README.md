# Travel AI Agent 

An AI-powered travel planning assistant developed during the **AICTE - IBM SkillsBuild Internship**.

##  Problem Statement
Planning a trip can be time-consuming and overwhelming, requiring users to search across multiple platforms for:
- Personalized travel itineraries
- Budget estimations
- Location-specific tips

**Solution:**  
The **Travel AI Agent** streamlines the process by interacting with users in natural language to:
- Collect key trip preferences (destination, days, budget)
- Generate personalized itineraries
- Estimate trip costs
- Offer location-specific travel advice

Due to platform limitations in student/SkillsBuild accounts, AI tools like Python were simulated through prompt engineering using the **LangGraph + ReAct** architecture.


##  Technologies Used
- IBM Watsonx.ai (LangGraph + ReAct)
- Granite LLM (Natural Language Generation)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Prompt Engineering
- Python (logic simulation)
- IBM Cloud Lite Services
- Jupyter Notebook



##  IBM Cloud Services
- IBM Watsonx AI Studio
- IBM Watsonx AI Runtime
- IBM Cloud Agent Lab
